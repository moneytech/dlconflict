/*
 * a tool that finds dynamic symbol conflicts at runtime
 *
 * how to use this?
 * compile this with:
 *  gcc dlconflict.c -shared -o dlconflict.so
 *
 * then whenever you want to test for symbol conflict 
 * (ideally after all other libraries are loaded, this happens before main)
 * you just need to load 'dlconflict.so' using dlopen
 * the rest is handled by a constructor function that runs on loading the library
 * a dump of the results will be printed on stderr
 * you might need to filter this again to ignore libc (it's a mess)
 *
 * #include <dlfcn.h>
 * int main(void)
 * {
 *      void *h = dlopen("path_to/dlconflict.so", RTLD_LAZY);
 *      if (!h){
 *          fprintf(stderr, "failed to load dlconflict.so");
 *      }
 * }
